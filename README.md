## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Student Profiles**: Dynamic sign-up logging the student's Name, Class/Grade (1 to 10), Board (CBSE, ICSE, State Board), and School Type.
2. **Today's Quest Planner**: Dynamically generates difficulty-appropriate daily checklists customized to the student's grade level.
3. **Duolingo Course Path Map**: Visual, winding zig-zag course pathway nodes. Clicking an unlocked chapter lets students challenge standard quizzes!

7. **Vector Analytics Reports**: Beautiful custom lightweight SVG graphs tracking weekly study hours and average subject accuracies (eliminating heavy chart library dependencies).
8. **Weak Subject Analysis**: Scans quiz histories, identifies topics with accuracy $<70\%$, and offers target revision actions.
9. **Secure Parent Portal**: Access locked behind a parent PIN. Provides child performance monitoring and advanced controls:
   - **Daily Limit Screen Lock**: Instantly lock the child out to enforce a screen break (requires parent PIN to unlock).
   - **Custom Chore Quests**: Add parent-assigned tasks that feed directly into the student's checklist.
   - **XP Rewards Cabinet**: Parents register custom incentives (e.g. "30m of game console time") that students can claim by redeeming their earned study XP!

## ⚡ Zero-Setup & Developer Conveniences

To provide the absolute best developer experience, StudyBuddy includes built-in fallbacks that allow it to run **flawlessly out-of-the-box**:
1. **DB Auto-Fallback**: The server automatically attempts to connect to a local MongoDB instance. If no instance is active, it seamlessly switches to a local file-based database (`backend/data/db.json`) and seeds default quizzes for all 10 grades automatically. **No database installation is required to test!**
2. **Bypass Demo Logins**: On the login page, you can bypass manual signups by clicking `Demo Student` or `Demo Parent` to immediately enter standard, populated student profiles!
